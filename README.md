## Content

I. **Project Context** 

This is a mini-terminal game where you would need to create a path to the hat so you can win the game.

## Rules

I. **Rules**

The rules are simple:
- Player's Location/Player's Path: *
- Available fields: ░;
- Hat's Location: ^
- Holes' Location: O

The Player MUST reach the **Hat's Location** so that it can win the game avoiding the holes around the path.
Check the [Commands](#commands) to know how to move throught the available #Fields.

## Commands

I. **Keyboard Commands**

Following the game's instructions, move:
- A: left;
- S: down;
- D: right;
- W: up;

The player's icon will move following your own commands

## Difficulty

I. **Uncomment Code**

In main.js there are some uncommented parts. I updated the mini-game to be on the hard mode and at a random starting position but since this app has different settings, you can uncomment some parts of the code to switch on easy mode, which means no holes are created during your moves and you can also set your starting position fixed or random

- *Fixed* means you will always start at 0,0 which is at the top left corner of the whole field.
- *Random* means everytime you start a new game, the player's location will be totally random through the whole field.
